Web Crawler QT

Note:
 
 Each thread scans Depth number of URL, so if you wnat to scan 40 urls, set Threads to 4, and Depth to 10 for example
 
 Search is case sensetive
 
 Compiled with MinGW 5.1
 
 Place OpenSSL libs nearly binary to make SSL work

To test:

 Ideal way is use some script language to create the three of folders with some index.htmls and hyperlinks inside of it.
 
 I tested with stackoverflow links.
